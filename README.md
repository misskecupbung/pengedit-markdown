# Pengedit Markdown

Lightweight Markdown editor built with React and `yamde`.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

Scripts

- `npm start` — start dev server
- `npm test` — run tests
- `npm run build` — build for production

Notes

- The editor component uses the `yamde` package. Edit content via the UI and changes are kept in React state.
- If you want a lighter dependency set, consider replacing `yamde` with another Markdown editor.
